      <h1 class="faq-title">What it's all about?</h1>
      <p>It's not usual keyboard racing. The majority of keyboard racing apps are concentrated around typing speed but our main
        goal is to improve your skill to avoid mistakes. That's why here is only one type of racing where you can make only two
        mistakes and then game will over.
      </p>
      <p>We are deeply convinced that ability to concentrate on avoding mistakes will make your typing speed much faster.
        And also it will give you much more pleasure from typing and clearer head because of the way of thinking that you will practice.

    <div class="question">
      <h1 class="faq-title">Don't you think that it's pretty hardcore game then?</h1>
      <p>
        Not at all. If you feel it, then you didn't still really understand what's this game about.
        You don't need to be scared of slow typing because there is no one interested in it here.
        Our top is based on success rate only. Just chill and try to reach the condition of mind that
        buddhist monks are training all the time. This is kind of meditation with keyboard.
        Just do it and everything will change at once.

    <div class="question">
      <h1 class="faq-title">Why I'm not in top?</h1>
      <p>You can reach the top only if you have at least 50 races.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h1 class="faq-title">There is 50 races history limit?</h1>
      <p>We have made it intentionally. This game is kind of mirror of your mind for now and we want to keep the results really fresh.</p>
